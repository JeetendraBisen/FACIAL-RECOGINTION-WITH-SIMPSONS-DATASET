# FACIAL-RECOGINTION-WITH-SIMPSONS-DATASET

In this project I have created a facial recoginition on kaggle from simpsons dataset using caer, tensorflow, canaro. the accuracy of this model is not up to the mark. I got to learn so much from this project. I am happy share my experience of this project with everyone. If anyone has any suggestion/issues with this code please kindly mail about it.
